      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>1830 - Belgium becomes the independent state, separating from the Netherlands. From this point into the late 19th century, the country faced a three-way language struggle between Dutch, French and German languages.</p>
      <p>In 1963, Belgium was divided into four language areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Dutch-speaking region: Flanders (the provinces of Antwerp, Limburg, Flemish Brabant, East and West Flanders)</li>
        <li>The French-speaking region: Wallonia (the provinces of Hainaut, Liege, Namur and Walloon Brabant)</li>
        <li>The German-speaking region (the nine municipalities of the East Cantons)</li>
        <li>The bilingual Brussels-Capital Region (the 19 Brussels municipalities) with six Dutch-speaking suburban municipalities with administrative language facilities for the French-speaking inhabitants.</li>
      </ul>
