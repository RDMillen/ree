      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>1830 - Belgium becomes the independent state, separating from the Netherlands. From this point into the late 19th century, the country faced a three-way language struggle between Dutch, French and German languages.</p>
      <p>In 1963, Belgium was divided into three language areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Dutch-speaking region: Flanders (the provinces of Antwerp, Limburg, Flemish Brabant, East and West Flanders)</li>
        <li>The French-speaking region: Wallonia (the provinces of Hainaut, Liege, Namur and Walloon Brabant)</li>
        <li>The German-speaking region (the nine municipalities of the East Cantons)</li>
        <li>The bilingual Brussels-Capital Region (the 19 Brussels municipalities) with six Dutch-speaking suburban municipalities with administrative language facilities for the French-speaking inhabitants.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Education System</h2>
        <p>In it's current form, the education is compulsory in some form from the age of five until eighteen. Pre-school is avaialble to children from the age of two to six but is not mandatory.</p>
        <p>Students are granted a certificate at the completion of each academic stage e.g completion of Primary/Secondary education.</p>
        <p>Secondary education comprises of three stages, each stage has two grades within.</p>
        <p>At stage one, students are given a broad, general education and does not focus on a specific subject area but lays groundwork for development in a specialsied subject area.</p>
        <p>From stage two, different options are given to students:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>General secondary education (gse), which focuses on broad general education. It does not prepare pupils for a specific profession, but rather lays a firm foundation for higher education.</li>
          <li>In technical secondary education (tse) attention goes in particular to general and technical-theoretical subjects. After tse a youngster may practice a profession or transfer to higher education. This type of education also contains practical training.</li>
          <li>Secondary education in the arts combines a broad general education with an active practice of art. After secondary education in the arts a youngster may practice a profession or transfer to higher education.</li>
          <li>Vocational secondary education (vse) is a practically-oriented type of education in which the youngster receives general education but where the focus primarily lies on learning a specific profession.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Upon completion of stage three, the student is presented with a certificate of upper secondary education, granting them access to higher education.</p>

        <p>Similarly to the United Kingdom, Belgium operates an alterantive "Learning and Working" scheme for young people aged fifteen to eighteen in place of stage three of their education.</p>
        <p>Universities in Wallonia and Flanders have different systems for calculating fees for students. Universities in Wallonia charge a fee set by the <a href="https://www.iau-hesd.net/organisation/academy-research-and-higher-education-ares" target="_blank">Academy of Research and High Education</a>.</p>
        <p>While in the Flanders region, EU and non-EU citizens must pay different tuition fees, starting from â‚¬900 per academic year. However, Begian universities take a students background into account when calculating fees e.g. higher fees for a student with a higher income, type of course, or available grants or scholarships.</p>
